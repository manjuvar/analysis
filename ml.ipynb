    "2. Data Type Conversion\n",
    "3. Data Consistency Checks\n",
    "4. In-Depth Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Assess Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "We'l start by examining the extent of missing values in each column. This will help us decide how to handle these missing values appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of missing values reveals that some columns have a high percentage of missing data. Here's how we can handle them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Columns with 100% Missing Values: These can be removed as they provide no information.\n",
    "2. Columns with a High Percentage of Missing Values (>90%): These columns are mostly missing and may not be useful for analysis unless they contain critical information.\n",
    "3. Other Columns with Missing Values: Depending on the importance of these columns and the nature of the missing data, we can consider imputing missing values or using them as is for specific analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll ensure that each column is of the appropriate data type for analysis. This includes converting date columns to datetime format and ensuring numerical columns are of numeric types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Consistency Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also perform checks for data consistency, like looking for outliers or incorrect entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "After addressing these steps, we can move on to in-depth analysis and visualization. Let's start with cleaning and data type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns are now in appropriate data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Date columns are in datetime64 format.\n",
    "- Numeric columns are in either int64 or float64 format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. In-Depth Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll move on to the in-depth analysis and visualization part. Given the nature of the data, we can explore several aspects such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. School Distribution by City and Area\n",
    "2. Analysis of School Features (like establishment year, grades offered, etc.)\n",
    "3. Geographical Distribution (using latitude and longitude)\n",
    "4. Temporal Trends (if applicable, e.g., in the creation of schools over time)\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1. School Distribution by City and Area\n",

    "- Distribution by City: Shows the number of schools in each city. Some cities have a higher concentration of schools than others.\n",
    "- Top 20 Areas by Number of Schools: Highlights the areas with the most schools. This can be useful for understanding which areas are educational hubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Analysis of School Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll analyze various school features such as establishment year, grades offered, etc. For this part, we'll focus on the 'establishment_year' and 'grades' columns. We can also explore other features based on your interest. Let's start with the distribution of schools by their establishment year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram shows the distribution of schools by their establishment year. This visualization helps understand trends in the establishment of schools over time, such as periods with higher or lower numbers of new schools.\n",

    "### 3. Geographical Distribution (Using Latitude and Longitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the geographical distribution of schools using latitude and longitude data. This will be a scatter plot to visualize the spread of schools geographically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter plot illustrates the geographical distribution of schools based on their latitude and longitude coordinates. This visualization is useful for identifying clusters of schools and their spread across different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Temporal Trends (Creation of Schools Over Time)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's explore any temporal trends, such as how the creation of schools has varied over time. We'll use the 'created_at' column for this analysis, examining the trend in the number of new school entries in the dataset over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line plot shows the trend of school creation over the years, based on the 'created_at' column. This trend analysis helps in understanding the growth or decline in the number of schools being added to the dataset over time.\n",

    "### Summary of In-Depth Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. School Distribution: We observed the distribution of schools across various cities and top areas.\n",
    "2. School Features: The establishment years of schools were analyzed to see trends in educational infrastructure development.\n",
    "3. Geographical Distribution: A scatter plot revealed the geographical spread of schools.\n",
    "4. Temporal Trends: We examined how the number of new schools recorded in the dataset varied over the years.\n",
